#Exercise: Write a method that does binary search. Specifically, it should accept two arguments. The first argument is an array of numbers that are in ascending order. The second argument is a number that may or may not be contained within the array. The method should perform binary search to find the index at which this second value is found within the array. If the value cannot be found within the array, the method should return nil.

def bino(array1, integer)
  # index = array1.length / 2
  center =


  while array1[index] > 2
    if array1[index] = integer
      puts "The number #{integer} is located at index #{index}"
      break
    else

  end
  
end
